"For simple constructions, we expect to see a negative filler effect when the gap is present (blue bars) and a positive effect when the gap is absent (orange bars). This is because a human-like learner should find a gap less surprising when a filler is present than when there is no filler, and vice versa when there is no gap. For island constructions, we expect that the confidence interval for the filler effect should overlap with zero because a human-like knowledge of islands suggests that a gap should be equally surprising regardless of the upstream presence of a filler; the same is true in the no-gap condition, using one of Wilcox et al. (2023)’s criteria. A less stringent relative metric for learning islands is a reduced effect relative to the filler effect in simple sentences (Wilcox et al., 2023); in other words, the difference in surprisal at the critical region decreases rather than disappears entirely." (Howitt)

Gap effect:
gap effect = +filler - -filler

Expectations (aligned with humans):
    simple
        +gap -> negative gap effect
        -gap -> positive gap effect
    island 
        +gap -> (closer to) 0 gap effect
        -gap -> (closer to) 0 gap effect
