**Data Organization (by folder)**

*original_howitt_data*:
- contains (all?) (eval only?) sentences generated by Howitt et al
- *c* files contain simple constructions
- *i* files contain island constructions 
- each eval item has 8 parts (ab, ax, xb, xx, abi, axi, xbi, xxi)
- each train item has four parts (ab, ax, ax, xx), but only the grammatical parts (ab, xx) should be used. 
- *c* files seem to match up with Howitt's evaluation set: 486 clefting, 486 topicalization with intro, 161 topicalization without intro, and 243 tough movement. But, they are missing (or are separated from) their island counterparts
- conditions: a/x refers to the presence/absence of a filler, b/x refers to the presence/absence of a gap. an i in the condition name indicated that the sentence contains an island.
	- ab = +filler +gap (grammatical)
	- xb = -filler +gap (ungrammatical)
	- ax = +filler -gap (ungrammatical)
	- xx = -filler -gap (grammatical)
- the criticalwords feild indicates words at which to evaluate model suprisal.


*processed_wilcox_data*:
- contains wilcox's WH-movement data, with Howitt's preprocessing. 

*note.* "_" represent theoretical gaps, and should not be used as tokens in model inputs/outputs
