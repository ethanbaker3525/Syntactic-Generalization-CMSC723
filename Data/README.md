***original_howitt_data***: sentences generated by Howitt et al
- train_cleft_grammar_c.csv contains training sentences for expierment 1.
	- each train item has four parts (ab, ax, ax, xx), but only the grammatical parts (ab, xx) should be used. 
- the remaning files are evalutation files. Across files there are roughly 486 clefting items, 486 topicalization with intro items, 161 topicalization without intro items, and 243 tough movement items.
	- *c* files contain simple constructions
	- *i* files contain island constructions 
	- each eval item has 8 parts (ab, ax, xb, xx, i_ab, i_ax, i_xb, i_xx). These items are split between *i* and *c* files.
	- the criticalwords feild indicates words at which to evaluate model suprisal.
- conditions: a/x refers to the presence/absence of a filler, b/x refers to the presence/absence of a gap.
	- ab = +filler +gap (grammatical)
	- xb = -filler +gap (ungrammatical)
	- ax = +filler -gap (ungrammatical)
	- xx = -filler -gap (grammatical)

***processed_wilcox_data***: contains wilcox's WH-movement data, with Howitt's preprocessing.

***splits***: contains our training and test splits
- eval files begin with eval_, train files begin with train_
- eval files were created by matching items in *c* files with corresponding items in *i* files (see interleaf.py)
	- each resulting group contains 8 sentences, where i indicated that sentences contain islands: 
		- ab = +filler +gap (grammatical)
		- xb = -filler +gap (ungrammatical)
		- ax = +filler -gap (ungrammatical)
		- xx = -filler -gap (grammatical)
		- i_ab = +filler +gap (ungrammatical)
		- i_xb = -filler +gap (ungrammatical)
		- i_ax = +filler -gap (ungrammatical)
		- i_xx = -filler -gap (grammatical)
- train files were created by removing ax and bx conditions. Training files contain only simple constructions.
